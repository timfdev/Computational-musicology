A first version of analyzing the valence in different albums.

```{r Plot}
  Swimming <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "0LGaHnLkACbfrYgJ3XhRHV")
  Macadelic <-get_playlist_audio_features("","2mJAUGPJcHA1sECMk76t7E")
  
Swimming_valence <- mean(Swimming[["valence"]])
Macadelic_valence <- mean(Macadelic[["valence"]])
albums <- c("Swimming", "Macadelic")
mean_valence <- c(Swimming_valence, Macadelic_valence)
plot <- data.frame(albums, mean_valence)

ggplot(plot,aes(albums, mean_valence)) +
  geom_point()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
